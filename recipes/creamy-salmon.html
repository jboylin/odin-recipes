    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Bring a medium pan of water to the
        boil. Add the potatoes and cook for 8 mins. Drain and leave to steam-dry
        in a colander for a few minutes. Toss the potatoes with Â½ of the oil and
        plenty of seasoning in a baking tray. Put in the oven for 20 mins,
        tossing halfway through the cooking time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a frying pan over a medium heat.
        Add the leek and fry for 5 mins, or until beginning to soften. Stir
        through the garlic for 1 min, then add the cream, capers and 75ml hot
        water, then bring to the boil. Stir through the chives.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the grill to high. Pour the creamy leek mixture over the potatoes,
        then sit the salmon fillets on top. Grill for 7-8 mins, or until just
        cooked through. Serve topped with extra chives and capers and a salad on
        the side, if you like.
